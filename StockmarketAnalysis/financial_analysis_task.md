TSLA Stock Analysis (2024):

Based on the latest data and information gathered from various sources like Yahoo Finance, StockAnalysis.com, TipRanks, and WSJ, here's a comprehensive analysis of Tesla's (TSLA) stock:

**Summary:**

Tesla's stock performance has been highly volatile, as indicated by a beta of ~2.35. The stock has seen significant price fluctuations in the past year, with a YTD change of roughly 57%. While the company has experienced substantial revenue growth, profitability remains a concern with a high P/E ratio.  Competition in the EV market is intensifying, posing challenges to Tesla's market share.

**Financial Standing:**

* **EPS (TTM):**  Around $3.65, showing some improvement in profitability.
* **Revenue Growth:** Strong revenue growth in recent quarters, driven by increased vehicle deliveries and expansion into other energy-related products. However, maintaining this growth trajectory is crucial for justifying the high valuation.
