## Comprehensive Summary of Latest News on Alice Weidel (as of February 8, 2025)

Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, has been a prominent figure in recent news, particularly in early 2025. A key development is her invitation by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to visit Hungary. This meeting, reported by Reuters on February 3, 2025, signifies a potential warming of relations between the AfD and Orbán's government, and it is interpreted as an erosion of the German far-right party's isolation within Europe. Other news highlights Weidel's role in the AfD, including discussions about the party's stance on historical events and its increasing prominence in German politics. A podcast from The Guardian, also from February 3, 2025, charts Weidel's rise within the party. There's also mention about an endorsement from Elon Musk and 5 million euros in financial donations.
