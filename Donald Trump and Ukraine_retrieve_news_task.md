**Summary:**

As of February 9, 2025, news reports indicate that US President Donald Trump is actively pushing for ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine.  While some sources suggest Trump's interest in negotiations, it remains unclear whether Vladimir Putin reciprocates this desire.  Trump's proposed peace plan may be revealed soon, potentially at an upcoming security conference.  Reports also suggest Trump is considering doubling down on sanctions against Russia to pressure them towards ending the war.  Controversially, discussions have emerged regarding Ukraine potentially exchanging mineral resources for US military aid, a proposal that has drawn criticism.  Furthermore, there are indications that the US desires Ukraine to hold elections following a ceasefire.
