Based on available information, AEP released Q3 2024 earnings on November 6, 2024.  GAAP earnings were $1.80 per share and operating earnings were $1.85 per share.  Full-year operating earnings guidance was narrowed to $5.58-$5.68 per share.  AEP also introduced a new growth rate and capital plan.  News articles mention a long-term growth rate of 6%-7%.  Some articles discuss AEP's financial resilience, strategic investments, and regulatory hurdles.  However, a comprehensive analysis requires access to the complete 10-K and 10-Q filings, which I do not have.  Therefore, I cannot provide a complete analysis or identify specific red flags or positive indicators at this time.  Further analysis would be necessary upon obtaining the full SEC filings.
