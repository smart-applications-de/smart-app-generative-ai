Due to limitations in accessing real-time job postings with the available tools, I cannot provide a list of 5 specific job opportunities. However, I can outline the process and the expected format of the results:

1. **Search on job boards:** I would use the "Search in a specific website" tool with queries like "Data Engineer Frankfurt" on websites like Indeed (indeed.com), StepStone (stepstone.de), LinkedIn (linkedin.com), and Xing (xing.com).

2. **Filter by location and date:**  I would refine the search results to focus on Frankfurt and prioritize recent postings, ideally around 2025-01-07.  Since this date is in the future, I would look for the most recent postings available.

3. **Extract information:** For the top 5 relevant and recent job postings, I would extract the following information:

    * **Job Title:** (e.g., Senior Data Engineer, Data Engineer - Cloud Platforms)
    * **Technical Skills:** (e.g., Python, SQL, AWS, Spark, Big Data)
    * **Work Experience:** (e.g., 3+ years, 5-7 years)
    * **Job Location:** (e.g., Frankfurt, Germany)
    * **Job Description:** (A summary of the job responsibilities and requirements)
    * **Website URL:** (The link to the full job posting)
    * **Job Posting Platform:** (e.g., Indeed.com, Stepstone.de)
    * **Company Name:** (e.g., Amazon, Google, BMW)

4. **Format as Markdown:** The extracted information would be presented in a markdown format as follows (example):

```markdown

This process would be repeated for each of the top 5 job postings.  I apologize that I cannot provide specific job details due to the tool limitations.
