Alice Weidel, co-leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has been nominated as the party's chancellor candidate for the upcoming German elections.  In early 2025, the AfD and Weidel have experienced a surge in prominence, marked by significant financial donations (reportedly â‚¬5 million this year) and an endorsement from Elon Musk.  This increased visibility is accompanied by continued controversy, particularly regarding Weidel's statements on the Holocaust and the party's far-right stance on migration.  The AfD has achieved a notable parliamentary success, with one of their motions being passed for the first time in the history of the federal German parliament.  Weidel's invitation to Hungary suggests a potential shift in the AfD's international relations, and the party's admiration for figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk has been noted.
