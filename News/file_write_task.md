**Tesla's Ambitious 2024 Delivery Goal Met with Doubt**

Tesla has announced its aim to significantly increase vehicle deliveries in 2024, according to a recent headline in *Investor's Business Daily*.  However, details surrounding this ambitious target remain unclear due to an inaccessible link to the original article.  The URL provided resulted in a "Page not found" error, preventing a full analysis of Tesla's projected growth and the factors contributing to the perceived unlikelihood of achieving it.

While the specific details of Tesla's delivery goals and the reasons for skepticism are currently unavailable due to the broken link, the headline suggests industry analysts and investors may have reservations about the company's ability to meet its targets.  Potential factors contributing to this skepticism could include ongoing supply chain challenges, increasing competition in the electric vehicle market, and macroeconomic uncertainties.

*Investor's Business Daily* suggests that achieving this growth may be an uphill battle for Tesla.  Further investigation and analysis are needed once a working link to the source material is provided.  This will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of Tesla's strategy and the challenges it faces in the coming year.  

We will update this article with more information as it becomes available.
