# Alice Weidel and the AfD: Shifting Alliances and Growing Influence

**Berlin, Germany (February 8, 2025)** – Alice Weidel, co-leader of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, has been at the center of recent political developments, signaling a potential shift in European far-right alliances and highlighting the AfD's growing prominence.

## Orbán's Invitation: A Break in Isolation

A key event marking this shift is Weidel's recent invitation to Hungary by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. The meeting, which took place in early February, represents a significant step towards closer ties between the AfD and Orbán's government. Reuters reports that this invitation demonstrates an "erosion of the German far-right party's isolation" within Europe.
