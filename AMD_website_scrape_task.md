**Summary of Latest News on AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.):**

Melius Research recently downgraded AMD (AMD) from a Buy rating to a Hold rating, lowering their price target from $160 to $129.  The downgrade is attributed to concerns about Nvidia's growing dominance in the AI chip market, rather than specific issues with AMD's new DeepSeek AI chip.  This downgrade follows a trend of several other analysts lowering their ratings or price targets for AMD in early 2025.  While AMD's long-term prospects in key growth areas like AI and servers are still being debated, the current market sentiment appears to be cautious.  The stock's performance has seen a "painful start" to the year, and investors are closely watching how AMD will respond to increasing competition.  Trading activity and investor sentiment may be influenced by this recent downgrade and the overall market conditions.
